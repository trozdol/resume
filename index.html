                    <h2>Overview:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Experienced architecting and developing enterprise fullstack and mobile applications in 
                        JavaScript (NodeJS), Java, PHP, Python, SQL etc. in the financial, energy, manufacturing, 
                        retail and government sectors. I've developed reusable libraries, defined development 
                        patterns and best practices for development teams, created utilities, configured databases, 
                        setup linux servers, CI/CD pipelines, using GitHub, Gitlab, and hosted training classes for 
                        Git and Javascript projects for multiple companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy learning about more than just my current area of expertise and sharing what I've learned with others.
                        I love to reduce the number of steps something takes, ideally a no-steps solution, but often times 1 step is perfect for most scenarios.
                        I do my best to try and make systems easy to understand.
                        I believe <b>code should be flexible to change without over-complicating the codebase or environment.</b>
                    </p>

                    <li>Built an ETL Java API for consuming and creating Excel templates used by multiple departments for handling new or changed data. One goal of this tool was to handle users rearranging or deleting columns in the template Excel file. Previous
                        import tools were fragile to change and often required hardcoded mapping of column indexes to field names. Not only was this problem solved but processing was reduced from minutes to seconds.</li>
                    <li>Created a server logging component to view server logs from the client for troubleshooting different problems not reproducible in a test environment. The server console could be launched from the browser’s debugger to see recent logs
                        or stack traces.</li>
                    <li>Worked in a small team to develop an ETL tool that could be used by various departments for editing records in bulk either chosen from the UI or from imported Excel files. Import performance of 50k+ records was reduced from hours or
                        days to minutes.</li>
                    <li>Analyzed code of COBOL CICS (green screen) tools to translate and develop Java web services to communicate with Db2. Developed web apps using ExtJS to create applications and tools to consume the Java services. Worked in an Agile development
                        environment across multiple teams.</li>
                    <li>Worked on development of hazardous shipping tools to reduce onboarding time needed for warehouse workers and prevent accidental violation of DOT Ground and Air shipping regulations.</li>
